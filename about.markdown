Hello! My name is Katelyn and I am so excited to have you stop by my blog!

I am originally from Minnesota, but right now I am attending Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. I am studying Statistics with a focus in statistical and data science. When I am not working or doing school work, I love to play pickleball and racquetball, go hiking and camping, and last, but not least - I love to eat GOOD food.
