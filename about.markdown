Hello! My name is Katelyn and I am so excited to have you stop by my blog! 

This blog was originally created as a class project, but is something that I want to use to continue posting about my latest projects in Python and R. I hope that my projects and tutorials can help other people learn how they can contribute to the world of data and statistics 😊.

### A little about me...

I am originally from Minnesota, but right now I am attending Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. I am studying Statistics 📉 with a focus in the statistical and data sciences. I work as a research assistant for the BYU Department of Statistics. When I am not working or doing school work, I love to play pickleball and racquetball, go hiking and camping, and last, but not least - I love 😍 to eat GOOD food.
