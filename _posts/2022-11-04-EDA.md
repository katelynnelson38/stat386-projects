Imagine you receive a random dataset that you aren't familiar with, but are asked to report back with insights to suggest further analyses that should be done. What do you do? üò± Panic? No! Start exploring the data and you might be surprised at what you come up with. üòè

When you have a new or unfamiliar dataset, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a great way to become familiar with your data! An EDA often includes asking questions that you want answered about the data, creating visuals to get an idea of what those answers might be, and refining your questions while also coming up with new ones you didn't think about before. Generally you won't do any in-depth analysis or modeling, but this is a great foundation for both of those things.

In this post I will go through a simple EDA on NASA's landslide data. The dataset contians various information on landslides around the world from 1988-2017. 

Here is a peek at what it looks like:

Check out my [nasa_api repository](https://github.com/katelynnelson38/nasa_api) and my [previous post](https://katelynnelson38.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/16/nasa_api.html) to see how I accessed and cleaned the data.

# Where to begin?

<!--
There are a lot of different ways to create plots in Python, but some of the most common packages are [matplotlib](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-plotting-in-python-set-1/), [pandas](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-plot-a-dataframe-using-pandas/), [seaborn](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/plotting-graph-using-seaborn-python/), and [plotly](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-plotly-tutorial/). I'll be using each of them in this post to give you an idea of how to use them, but take a look at the links I attached to each of them for more detail.

I like to import them with aliases that are commonly used like this...
```
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```
-->

A good way to start is by making a list of questions you have about your data. What do you want to know? What could you learn from the variables in the dataset? Here's a list of questions that I came up with about the landslide data:

- Can I plot the location of each landslide on a map?
- What are the most common landslide triggers? Are some more common in certain countries?
- Does the type of trigger affect the size of the landslide?
- Do larger landslides have more devastating effects (injuries and fatalities)?
- Are there certain months that have more landslides? More devastating landslides? Is this different in the Northern and Southern hemispheres?

Now that I've spent some time thinking about what I want to learn from the data, I will use visuals find general answers to these questions.

# Exploratory data analysis

### Map of landslides

I want to start by using the latitude and longitude to plot a map of landslides because this might helpme identify geographical patterns.

(plotly makes super awesome geographical maps)
```
px.scatter_geo(landslide_df, lat = 'latitude', lon = 'longitude', hover_name = 'country_name')
```
![map plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/katelynnelson38/stat386-projects/main/assets/images/edapost/map_plot.PNG)

Right away I can see that most landslides occur near coastal areas. I also notice that there are only landslides in the southern hemisphere. Were there no landslides in the Northern hemisphere between 2006 and 2017? Are we missing that data? Looking at the [data documentation](https://data.nasa.gov/Earth-Science/Global-Landslide-Catalog-Export/dd9e-wu2v), there is no mention of the data only including lanslides in the southern hemisphere, but further research shows that there are definitely landslides in the northern hemisphere.

### Comparing landslide size and triggers

Now I want to see what I can learn about the most common landslide sizes and triggers.

![size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/katelynnelson38/stat386-projects/main/assets/images/edapost/common_size.png)

It looks like landslides categorized as 'medium' are the most common.

![trigger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/katelynnelson38/stat386-projects/main/assets/images/edapost/common_trigger.png)

The most common landslide trigger is 'downpour', but if we look closer 3 of the 4 most common are rain. It might be interesting to find other data that contains the amount rainfall to see if areas with more landslides or larger landslides receive more rain.

### Landslide fatalities and injuries

What is the affect of size on the number of fatalities? Some landslides, regardless of size, do not have any fatalities so I used a boxplot to get an idea of the range of fatalities that each size has.

![boxplot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/katelynnelson38/stat386-projects/main/assets/images/edapost/boxplot_size_fatality.png)

As expected, as the landslides get larger the maximum and median values for fatalities increases. 

(**Note:** I got rid of outliers by filtering out landslides with a fatality rate greater than 100)

Which countries have the highest fatalities caused by landslides during the years 1988-2017?

![fatalities country](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/katelynnelson38/stat386-projects/main/assets/images/edapost/fatalities_country.png)

It would also be interesting to see if these countries have more landslides than others or if they are generally large landslides. If not would this indicate that these countries are less prepared than other with less fatalities?

### Time

We already know that the primary cause of landslides is rain, so will there be more landslides during the rainy months? Will there be more fatalities during those months?

![fatalities year](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/katelynnelson38/stat386-projects/main/assets/images/edapost/landslides_month.png)

Keeping in mind that this data is all in the southern hemisphere, there appears to be more landslides during warmer months. This could also be the rainy season, but we do not know.

![fatalities month](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/katelynnelson38/stat386-projects/main/assets/images/edapost/fatalities_month.png)

We can definitely see that during the months with more landslides there also seem to be more fatalities. It also seems likely that this is due to rainfall, but we probably need more information in order conclude that.

### Findings and future steps

Based on these figures and questions there are a few things we could run further analyses on. One of the most relvant things would be to get data on rainfall to see if we could understand that relationship and use it for predictive analyses.

**What else?**

<!--
## Barplots

## Boxplots

## Histograms and density plots

## Time series plotting

## Geoplotting

# Final thoughts...

Now remember, an EDA is not meant to tell you why something is happening or allow you to predict anything - that comes next. An EDA helps you get to know your data and start asking important questions that will help with future projects.

Keep in mind that not everything you do in an EDA will end up being useful. I made plenty of figures and plots that didn't give me any insight about the landslide data. üòê

If you want more ideas of what to include in your EDA, check out the [Exploratory Data Analysis chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html) in the book R for Data Science.
