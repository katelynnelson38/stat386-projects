Imagine you receive a random dataset that you aren't familiar with, but are asked to report back with insights to suggest further analyses that should be done. What do you do? üò± Panic? No! Start exploring the data and you might be surprised at what you come up with. üòè

When you have a new or unfamiliar dataset, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a great way to become familiar with your data! An EDA often includes asking questions that you want answered about the data, creating visuals to get an idea of what those answers might be, and refining your questions while also coming up with new ones you didn't think about before. Generally you won't do any in-depth analysis or modeling, but this is a great foundation for both of those things.

In this post I will go through a simple EDA on NASA's landslide data. The data and code I use can be found in my GitHub repo [nasa_api](https://github.com/katelynnelson38/nasa_api). Check out my [previous post](https://katelynnelson38.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/16/nasa_api.html) to see how I accessed and cleaned the data.

# Where do I begin?

<!--
There are a lot of different ways to create plots in Python, but some of the most common packages are [matplotlib](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-plotting-in-python-set-1/), [pandas](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-plot-a-dataframe-using-pandas/), [seaborn](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/plotting-graph-using-seaborn-python/), and [plotly](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-plotly-tutorial/). I'll be using each of them in this post to give you an idea of how to use them, but take a look at the links I attached to each of them for more detail.

I like to import them with aliases that are commonly used like this...
```
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```
-->

A good way to start is by making a list of questions you have about your data. What do you want to know? What could you learn from the variables in the dataset? Here's a list of questions that I came up with about the landslide data:

- Can I plot the location of each landslide on a map?
- What are the most common landslide triggers? Are some more common in certain countries?
- Does the type of trigger affect the size of the landslide?
- Do larger landslides have more devastating effects (injuries and fatalities)?
- Are there certain months that have more landslides? More devastating landslides? Is this different in the Northern and Southern hemispheres?

Now that I've spent some time thinking about what I want to learn from the data, I can use visuals and find numbers to answer these questions.

Note: If you want to follow along import these packages
```
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```
Now let's dive into our data!

# Exploratory data analysis

### Map of landslides

I want to start by using the latitude and longitude to plot a map of landslides because this might help direct the rest of my EDA.

(plotly makes super awesome geographical maps)
```
px.scatter_geo(landslide_df, lat = 'latitude', lon = 'longitude', hover_name = 'country_name')
```
![map plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/katelynnelson38/stat386-projects/main/assets/images/edapost/map_plot.PNG)

Right away I notice that there are only landslides in the southern hemisphere. Were there no landslides in the Northern hemisphere between 2006 and 2017? Are we missing that data? 

Looking at the [data documentation](https://data.nasa.gov/Earth-Science/Global-Landslide-Catalog-Export/dd9e-wu2v), there is no mention of the data only including lanslides in the southern hemisphere, but further research shows that there are definitely landslides in the northern hemisphere. This will be good to keep in mind for the reast of our EDA.

### Comparing landslide triggers



### Landslide fatalities and injuries

### Months

### Keep in mind: Not everything in an EDA is useful
