Imagine you receive a random dataset that you aren't familiar with, but are asked to report back with insights to suggest further analyses that should be done. What do you do? üò± Panic? No! Start exploring the data and you might be surprised at what you come up with. üòè

When you have a new or unfamiliar dataset, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a great way to become familiar with your data! An EDA often includes asking questions that you want answered about the data, creating visuals to get an idea of what those answers might be, and refining your questions while also coming up with new ones you didn't think about before. Generally you won't do any in-depth analysis or modeling, but this is a great foundation for both of those things.

In this post I will go through a simple EDA on NASA's landslide data. The dataset contians various information on landslides around the world from 1988-2017. 

Here is a peek at what it looks like:

Check out my [nasa_api repository](https://github.com/katelynnelson38/nasa_api) and my [previous post](https://katelynnelson38.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/16/nasa_api.html) to see how I accessed the data and how I created the plots below.

# Where to begin?

<!--
There are a lot of different ways to create plots in Python, but some of the most common packages are [matplotlib](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-plotting-in-python-set-1/), [pandas](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-plot-a-dataframe-using-pandas/), [seaborn](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/plotting-graph-using-seaborn-python/), and [plotly](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-plotly-tutorial/). I'll be using each of them in this post to give you an idea of how to use them, but take a look at the links I attached to each of them for more detail.

I like to import them with aliases that are commonly used like this...
```
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```
-->

A good way to start is by making a list of questions you have about your data. What do you want to know? What could you learn from the variables in the dataset? Here's a list of questions that I came up with about the landslide data:

- Can I plot the location of each landslide on a map?
- What are the most common landslide triggers? Are some more common in certain countries?
- Does the type of trigger affect the size of the landslide?
- Do larger landslides have more devastating effects (injuries and fatalities)?
- Are there certain months that have more landslides? More devastating landslides? Is this different in the Northern and Southern hemispheres?

Now that I've spent some time thinking about what I want to learn from the data, I will use visuals to find general answers to these questions.

# Exploratory data analysis

### Map of landslides

I want to start by using the latitude and longitude to plot a map of landslides because this might help me identify geographical patterns.

(plotly makes super awesome geographical maps)
```
px.scatter_geo(landslide_df, lat = 'latitude', lon = 'longitude', hover_name = 'country_name')
```
![map plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/katelynnelson38/stat386-projects/main/assets/images/edapost/map_plot.PNG)

Right away I can see that most landslides occur near coastal areas. I also notice that there are only landslides in the southern hemisphere. Were there no landslides in the Northern hemisphere between 2006 and 2017? Are we missing that data? Looking at the [data documentation](https://data.nasa.gov/Earth-Science/Global-Landslide-Catalog-Export/dd9e-wu2v), there is no mention of the data only including lanslides in the southern hemisphere, but further research shows that there are definitely landslides in the northern hemisphere, so they must not be included in this dataset.

### Comparing landslide size and triggers

Now I want to see what I can learn about the most common landslide sizes and triggers.

![size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/katelynnelson38/stat386-projects/main/assets/images/edapost/common_size.png)

The graph above shows that landslides categorized as 'medium' are the most common.

![trigger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/katelynnelson38/stat386-projects/main/assets/images/edapost/common_trigger.png)

The bar graph above shows that the most common landslide trigger is 'downpour'. Looking even closer at the other common triggers, we see that 3 of the top 4 most common are realted to some kind of rain. This makes me think that it might be interesting to find data that contains the amount rainfall to see if areas with more landslides or larger landslides receive more rain.

### Landslide fatalities and injuries

One thing I wondered was: what is the affect of size on the number of fatalities? Some landslides, regardless of size, do not have any fatalities so I used a boxplot to get an idea of the range of fatalities that each size has. (**Note:** in order to get a more useful plot, I got rid of outliers by filtering out landslides with a fatality rate greater than 100)

![boxplot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/katelynnelson38/stat386-projects/main/assets/images/edapost/boxplot_size_fatality.png)

As we can intuitively expect, the plot above shows that as landslides get larger the maximum and median values for fatalities increases. 

I am also intereted in knowing which countries have the highest fatality rate from landslides during the years 1988-2017 and the possible implications that might have.

![fatalities country](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/katelynnelson38/stat386-projects/main/assets/images/edapost/fatalities_country.png)

Looking at the graph above, Tanzania has the highest rate, averaging 20 fatalities per landslide. This could be because the lanslides in Tanzania are larger than in most other countries, or maybe they are less prepared than other countries. These would be interesting ideas to look into.

### Time

We already know that the primary cause of landslides is rain, so will there be more landslides during the rainy months? Will there be more fatalities during those months?

![fatalities year](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/katelynnelson38/stat386-projects/main/assets/images/edapost/landslides_month.png)

Keeping in mind that this data is all in the southern hemisphere, there appears to be more landslides during warmer months. This could also be the rainy season, but we do not know.

![fatalities month](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/katelynnelson38/stat386-projects/main/assets/images/edapost/fatalities_month.png)

We can definitely see that the months with more landslides there also seem to be more fatalities. It also seems likely that this is due to rainfall, but we probably need more information in order conclude that.

### Findings and future steps

After exploring this data we have learned a few things about landslides including (but not limited to üòâ):

- landslides are triggered and affected by rainfall
- larger landslides have more fatalities (kinda obvious I know ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)
- summer months have more landslides and fatalities

Based on these findings there are a few things I want to look into:

- data on rainfall to compare with landslides
- look into landslides in the northern hemisphere
- try to understand why some countries have higher fatality rates during landslides
- can I model fatalities based on the rest of the information in the dataset?

BUT there are so many other things we could look into as well!

# Final thoughts...

Now remember, an EDA is not meant to tell you why something is happening or allow you to predict anything - that comes next. An EDA helps you get to know your data and start asking important questions that will help with future projects. Not everything you do in an EDA will end up being useful either. I made plenty of figures and plots that didn't give me any insight about the landslide data.

If you want more ideas of what to include in your EDA, check out the [Exploratory Data Analysis chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html) in the book *R for Data Science*.
