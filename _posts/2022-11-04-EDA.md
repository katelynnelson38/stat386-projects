Imagine you receive a random dataset that you aren't familiar with, but are asked to report back with insights to suggest further analyses that should be done. What do you do? üò± Panic? No! Start exploring the data and you might be surprised at what you come up with. üòè

When you have a new or unfamiliar dataset, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a great way to become familiar with your data! An EDA often includes asking questions that you want answered about the data, creating visuals to get an idea of what those answers might be, and refining your questions while also coming up with new ones you didn't think about before. Generally you won't do any in-depth analysis or modeling, but this is a great foundation for both of those things.

In this post I will go through a simple EDA on NASA's landslide data. The data and code I use can be found in my GitHub repo [nasa_api](https://github.com/katelynnelson38/nasa_api). Check out my [previous post](https://katelynnelson38.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/16/nasa_api.html) to see how I accessed and cleaned the data.

# Where do I begin?

We're going to use some basic plotting tools in Python, so if you aren't already familiar with plotting in Python I recommend reading up [here](https://wesmckinney.com/book/plotting-and-visualization.html).

There are a lot of different ways to create plots in Python, but some of the best packages to use are [matplotlib](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-plotting-in-python-set-1/), [pandas](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-plot-a-dataframe-using-pandas/), [seaborn](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/plotting-graph-using-seaborn-python/), and [plotly](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-plotly-tutorial/).
