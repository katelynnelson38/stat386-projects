Every data analysis begins with 'data' (see what I did there? ðŸ˜‰). So where can you get data without putting the effort into collecting your own? An API (application programming interface) is a powerful tool that acts as a bridge between your device and a database so that you can access existing data. To use an API you need a unique 'key' that acts as a personal password to authenticate your access to the data. There are a lot of free APIs online that you can request keys for, but sometimes they require paid subscriptions.

If you want to learn more about APIs, I recommend starting [here].

# Set up

Before we can start, you will need to [create an account](https://data.nasa.gov/login) to NASA's Open Data Portal and [request an API key](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#signUp). In this post I will be using NASA's [Global Landslide Catalog Export](https://data.nasa.gov/Earth-Science/Global-Landslide-Catalog-Export/dd9e-wu2v) data.
