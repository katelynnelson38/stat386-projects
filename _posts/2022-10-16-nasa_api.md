Every data analysis begins with 'data' (see what I did there? 😉). So where can you get data without putting the effort into collecting your own? An API (application programming interface) is a powerful tool that acts as a bridge between your device and a database so that you can access existing data. To use an API you need a unique 'key' that acts as a personal password to authenticate your access to the data. There are a lot of free APIs online that you can request keys for, but sometimes they require paid subscriptions.

If you want to learn more about APIs, I recommend starting [here]().

**Note:** All of the code that I used to complete this tutorial can be found in my github repository [repo]().

# Set up

Before we can start, you will need to [create an account](https://data.nasa.gov/login) to NASA's Open Data Portal and [request an API key](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#signUp). I recommend copying your API key and pasting it into text file to use for later use. In this post I will be using NASA's [Global Landslide Catalog Export](https://data.nasa.gov/Earth-Science/Global-Landslide-Catalog-Export/dd9e-wu2v) data.

In a python file...

To connect to the NASA API we will use the beautiful soup and requests packages, so make sure to import those.

```
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
```

For privacy and legal purposes, I will not share my API key, but if you put yours in a text file it should work the same. I named my file `nasa_apikey.txt` so in the code below substitute your file name.

```
with open('nasa_apikey.txt', 'r') as file:
    nasa_key = file.read()
```

```
nasa_url = 'https://data.nasa.gov/resource/dd9e-wu2v.json'
r = requests.get(nasa_url, headers=headers, data = payload)
landslide = r.json()
landslide_df = pd.DataFrame(landslide)
landslide_df.head(3)
```

# Conclusion

Stay tuned 👀 for my next post where I will do an EDA (exploratory data analysis) with the landslide data!
