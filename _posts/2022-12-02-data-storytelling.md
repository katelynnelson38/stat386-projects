In this post I am going to wrap up with the landslide data that I've been working with and focus in on ....

# Quick recap

I came across this landslide dataset on the NASA's Open Data Portal and thought it would be interesting to see what I could learn. ⚠️Be warned: I am not an expert in landslides or any other environmental phenomenon, but I love using data to explore new topics and I thought this would be fun to explore. To get the data I used a personal API key (requested on the data portal website) and pulled the data into a Jupyter Notebook file. It turned out to be a pretty big and messy dataset, so I did some data wrangling and chose which fields I wanted to focus on. If you want to see the steps I took check out my other [blog post](https://katelynnelson38.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/16/nasa_api.html) and my [github reopsitory](https://github.com/katelynnelson38/nasa_api).

Once the data was nice and tidy, I could begin to learn from it. So after brainstorming ⛈️ some questions, I explored their possible answers through plots that I included as part of my [exploratory data analysis](https://katelynnelson38.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/11/14/EDA.html). My exploring gave me insights about common causes of landslides, occurances of landslides across time, which countries have more fatal landslides, and more.
